While working at [WMcCann](https://wmccann.com) I worked along with our digital team in a country wide campaign for [TIM](https://tim.com.br).

They wanted to increase awareness and acquisition of their new mobile plans in a broad offline and online campaign.

We built and launched multiple landing pages and ads that allowed brand ambassadors to interact with customers in a real time live streaming.

It was a very fun and challeging project to be part of, requiring lots of orchestration and cool tech to make sure every moving part was ready for the country wide launch.
