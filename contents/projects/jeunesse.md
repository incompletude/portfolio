In 2018 I was invited to a team to work on a video streaming web app prototype to Jeunesse. They wanted to build a cheaper, scalable and reliable comunication channel for their partners.

It was a very cool project to be involved with. It was based on a PHP stack, video streaming APIs, and a design system we built from scratch.
