In 2018 I was invited to a team to work on a video streaming web app prototype to [Jeunesse](https://jeunesseglobal.com).

They wanted to build a cheaper, scalable and reliable comunication channel for their partners.

It was a fun and challenging project to be involved with. It was based on **PHP**, video streaming APIs, and a **design system** we built from scratch.
