While working at [WMcCann](https://wmccann.com), our team worked on a digital product catalog for [Deca](https://deca.com.br).

They wanted to provide easy access to their catalog of thousands of houseware products to mutiple user journeys, from end users to architects and engineers.

Our digital team conceptualized and built a web app based on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), involving a [SAP](https://www.sap.com) integration to facilitate content upload, and a custom search engine based on [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org) to ease product queries.

It was a fun and challenging project to be part of.
