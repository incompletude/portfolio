While working at [WMcCann](https://wmccann.com), our team worked on multiple pro bono projects to [Hospital de Amor](https://hcancerbarretos.com.br) (former Hospital de CÃ¢ncer de Barretos) in Brazil.

Our goal was to increase awareness and raise funds for [Hospital de Amor](https://hcancerbarretos.com.br), one of the biggest cancer treatment centers in Latin America.

We built and launched multiple activation websites based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), achieving broad media coverage in a short time.

It was a very fulfilling experience to work along with children and artists to help people in need.
